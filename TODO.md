## What I need to implement in what oder.

*Funny thing is I have already done all this but porting and I just keep refactoring the whole framework as it's purely a library. Aanyway :), Let's do this.*

0. Create A CLI (admin,operator,soc) and some login functionality for each
1. Finish on all DB Persistence for the server
2. Create a session
3. Create an Implant Generator
4. Create a Session manager
5. Create a Listener and a Handler for each to identify the clients
6. Get the edr data coz you can (you just have to open windows clone this repo and git add. Literary that but I am just so.....)
7. Create a simple UI for both Operator and SOC
8. Build the libraries for the plugins.
